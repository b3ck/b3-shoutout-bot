Twitch bot that checks if user from chat has streamed within 7 days, if they have it will auto shout them out in chat.


- download `index.js` and `.env` files.
- edit `.env` file accordingly. (Get your oauth from [Twitch TMI](https://twitchapps.com/tmi/), Get Client ID/Secret by registering an app on [Twitch Dev Console](https://dev.twitch.tv/console/apps/)
- install node if you haven't already. ([Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/))
- open terminal/command prompt.
- run these commands:

```
npm init -y
```

```
npm install
```

After everything is installed run command in command prompt before streaming:
```

Once you are done streaming press CTRL+C to gracefully shutdown script, you must start and stop the script each time you stream.
